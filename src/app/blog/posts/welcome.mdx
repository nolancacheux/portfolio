## Hello and Welcome!

I'm Nolan Cacheux, a Data Scientist and ML Engineer based in Lille, France. This portfolio showcases my journey in the world of AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

## My Focus Areas

### Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

I specialize in taking ML models from experimentation to production. This includes:
- Building scalable ML pipelines
- Implementing model versioning and monitoring
- Setting up CI/CD for ML workflows

### Time-Series Forecasting

At Decathlon, I've developed forecasting solutions that predict sales across multiple dimensions:
- Revenue and items sold predictions
- Weather and holiday feature integration
- Multi-output Prophet models

### LLM Applications

I'm currently working on building AI assistants using:
- LangChain for orchestration
- RAG architectures for accurate responses
- Integration with enterprise systems

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing insights and learnings from my projects here. Stay tuned for articles on:
- MLOps best practices
- Time-series forecasting techniques
- Building production-ready AI solutions
